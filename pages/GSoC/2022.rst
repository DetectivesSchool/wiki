====================================

The following are the proposed projects for inclusion into Google Summer of Code 2022.

PyZombis
--------

   :align: left

A Community course, completely online and interactive, to teach Python to everyone! http://pyar.github.io/PyZombis *draft*

The original Brazilian MOOC Python para Zumbis created by Fernando Masanori has +500k reproductions on Youtube and taught over 70K students basic Python.

Goals: all lectures and exercises should be done fully online (Python on Javascript using Brython).
No need to install python on their computer. Execution servers are not required either.
Some lectures still need further work (databases, games).

- Project information:
    - `Repository <https://github.com/PyAr/PyZombis>`__
    - `Good first issues <https://github.com/PyAr/PyZombis/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22>`__

- Project ideas: 
    - SQL python lectures using javascript (SQLite.js) `#193 <https://github.com/PyAr/PyZombis/issues/193>`__ 
    - PyGame lecture using javascript "wrapper" like `gamejs <http://gamejs.org/showcase.html#pygame-vs-gamejs>`__

- Difficulty level: Medium / Intermediate

- Technologies involved: Python, Javascript

- Potential mentor: Mariano Reingart

PyEmpaq
-------

PyEmpaq is a simple but powerful Python packer to run any project with any virtualenv dependencies anywhere.

With PyEmpaq you can convert any Python project (see limitations below) into a single .pyz file with all the project's content packed inside.

Both the packaging and the execution are fully multiplatform. This means that you can pack a project in Linux, Windows, Mac, or whatever, and it will run ok in Linux, Windows, Mac, or whatever. The only requirement is Python to be already installed.

- Potential mentor: Facundo Batista

OpenLex

--------

Electronic Invoice, Agriculture, Foreign Trade, Taxes, Pharmaceutical, etc.

Library for Developers (integrators and legacy languages interfaces) Tools for Accountants and SMEs (Odoo/OpenERP modules and Tryton Argentina's localization)

PyAFIPWs is a widespread standard reference implementation to communicate with Argentina’s government entities, with more than +1.5K users group subscriptions, many bindings to other languages, and used in modules for Open Source ERP localizations (OpenERP, Odoo, Tryton, etc.)

    - Automation: build windows installers in continuous integration (see  `Wiki: Install <https://github.com/reingart/pyafipws/wiki/InstalacionCodigoFuente#generaci%C3%B3n-de-instalador>`__ to automate)
    - Webservice simulator: fake implementation for testing, mimicking government servers (WSDL SOAP based, see `server.py <https://github.com/pysimplesoap/pysimplesoap/blob/master/pysimplesoap/server.py#L539>`__ for a Proof of Concept)

About Python Argentina
======================

We are looking for new Pythonistas!

Help us to foster the development of several open-source community projects. Many are fun and innovative, others are challenging and resolve real-world requirements.

The association was founded aiming to help the Python devs, increase their diversity and outreach, especially overcoming minorities and cultural barriers (mainly socioeconomic, language, gender), serving as an umbrella organization to some ongoing efforts.

Spanish is one of the most spoken languages in the world, and many of our developed tools and libraries are aimed to fill the missing open-source gap.
They can help to learn and further work with Python, either to enthusiasts, professional programmers, or even final users!

Experienced developers, teachers, and volunteers will assist you, guiding you throughout the process with well-defined goals (according to skills and tech background)

Contacting Us
-------------

We're in the Argentina time zone (GMT-3)

* Telegram: https://t.me/+ljnpIYBUMLI3MDAx
* Forum: https://pyar.discourse.group/
* Email: secretaria+gsoc@ac.python.org.ar

NOTE: Spanish is a requisite for many projects, as it is the language used for documentation and community communications. 
On the other side, if you do not speak English fluently, we can help you with translations and guidance (in Spanish, of course).

NOTA: Si hablás Español pero te cuesta el Inglés, te podemos ayudar con las traducciones y redacciones para que puedas participar! No te preocupes, el día a día y documentación en general están en Castellano.

Visitá nuestra GSoC Wiki en Español para más información: https://wiki.python.org.ar/gsoc/

We want our community to be more diverse: whoever you are, and whatever your background, we welcome you.

Queremos que nuestra comunidad sea más diversa: quienquiera que seas, sea cual sea tu origen, te damos la bienvenida

Getting Started
===============

If you want to participate as a contributor, please follow the next guidelines:

Presenting yourself
-------------------

Write to the Telegram group about you. State clearly:

* Why you want to participate in GSoC, shortly comment your background and expectations
* What project would you prefer: look at this page for ideas
* What is your previous experience, Python skills, Django, hg/git, js, etc.

Fixing a bug!
-------------

* Ask for a simple ticket. For example, take a look at CDPedia, PyAfipWs, OpenLex, PyZombis.
* Create a user in GitHub (if you don't have one)
* Fork the project repository and try to fix an issue of your desired project
* Discuss with potential mentors your fix, creating a Pull Request as early as possible!

Writing a Proposal
------------------

* Select a project idea and write a detailed proposal using Google Docs (in advance!)
* Define 3 milestones & deliverables (i.e. Proof-Of-Concept, Prototype, Final Demo)
* Tasking out (high-level goals for each milestone)
* Describe the acceptance criteria ("Minimum Viable Product" of each phase)

Share an early draft (based on the Application Template, using Google Docs) and discuss your approach in the group with mentors
Do not forget to submit your application to the Google system when ready, before the deadline

IMPORTANT:
----------

Late, incomplete, or low-quality proposals will not be considered at all. 
Mentor's time and available students slots are limited, so please ask intelligently for advice and feedback early.

Last-minute applications are generally a signal of further problems (for you and for us too, please avoid!).
Proposals without any previous contribution in the repository (i.e. bug-fix issue) will be rejected.

You're expected to have an almost full-time dedication to the GSoC, so plan accordingly and disclose any potential commitment (exams, work, vacations, travels, etc.)
